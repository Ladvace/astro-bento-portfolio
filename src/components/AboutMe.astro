      Hi, I'm Gianmarco, a front-end software developer from Italy. My primary
      tools of choice includes: JavaScript, React, Solidjs, Astro, Svelte,
      Nodejs. Beyond coding, I'm passionate about design, illustration,
      animation and 3D modelling and traveling. An unusual hobby of mine is
      collecting vintage passports, they're interesting pieces of history to me.
      While I have some preferred tools, I always choose the best one for the
      job, even if it's not on my usual list. My goal is to find the right
      solution for each project.
