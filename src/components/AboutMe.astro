      Hi, I'm Gianmarco, a front-end software developer from Italy.
      <br />
       My primary tools of choice includes:
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
        <li>JavaScript</li>
        <li>React</li>
        <li>Solidjs</li>
        <li>Astro</li>
        <li>svelte</li>
        <li>Nodejs</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p class="text-sm font-light">
      Beyond coding, I'm passionate about design and 3D modeling and traveling.
      An unusual hobby of mine is collecting vintage passports, they're
      interesting pieces of history to me.
    </p>
    <p class="text-sm font-light">
      While I have some preferred tools, I always choose the best one for the
      job, even if it's not on my usual list. My goal is to find the right
      solution for each project.
